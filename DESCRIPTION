Description: Network trees recursively partition the data with respect to covariates. 
Two network tree algorithms are available: model-based trees based on a multivariate normal 
model and nonparametric trees based on covariance structures. After partitioning, 
correlation-based networks (psychometric networks) can be fit on the partitioned data.
